I had to reset my old mac from scratch today. Here I am going to document the steps to reproduce my environment.

The main plan is as follows:
1. Configure MacOs to my preferred defaults
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. Install basic tools
4. Install my dotfiles from https://github.com/korya/dotfiles
5. Install all required tools
6. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)
7. Other configurations


## Configure MacOS

### Change MacOS hostname

By default, MacOS sets the hostname to a ridiculous value based on your name.
Something as "Dmitri's MacBook Pro". I prefer to name my machines after latin or
greek gods. Easy to remember and easy to identify them in the office network.

```sh
NEW_HOSTNAME="mercury"
sudo scutil --set ComputerName "${NEW_HOSTNAME}"
sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "${NEW_HOSTNAME}"
```

### MacOS UI Settings

The only changes I make to the default settings are:

- Trackpad:
   * Enable `Tap to click`. I just cannot work with a trackpad when this option is
      disabled. Pressing the trackpad make me feel weird.

- Dock:
  * Move the dock to the left. The real estate at the center of the screen is very
     precious and hence, I try to free it up for the content that requires my
     attention at this current moment. Dock is very useful and should be available
     fast when needed. But not that important to be at the bottom of the screen.

   * Turn on magnification effect on the Docker and set it to the mid level.

   * Auto-hide the dock. I don't need to see it all the time.

   * Clean it up. Remove all these stock apps from the dock. Keep Finder,
      Launchpad, Safari (later will be replaced with Chrome) and Notes.

- Desktops:
   * Disable `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use`. I don't
      want to be distracted by the changes in the desktops order.

In the past (over 5 years ago), I had some magic CLI commands for doing these
changes. But it used to break with almost every major OS ugprade.

It would be great to get these magic CLI commands for the latest MacOS. Need to check whether ChatGPT can help with that.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is my default package manager in MacOS.

Follow the instructions at https://brew.sh/. At this moment, they are:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install Basic Tools

Basic tools (GBU core utils and other CLI utils):

```sh
brew install coreutils binutils diffutils ed findutils moreutils \
  gawk gnu-indent gnu-sed gnu-tar gnu-which gnutls grep gzip gpg2 \
  watch wdiff gpatch m4 make cmake file-formula \
  bash bash-completion@2 less wget curl socat git openssh python \
  rsync svn unzip tree rename jq \
  macvim nvim
```

## Install my dotfiles

Now that the basic tools are installed (including `git`), the dotfile can be
installed from Github.

My dotfiles are available at https://github.com/korya/dotfiles

```sh
cd ~
git init .
git remote add origin https://github.com/korya/dotfiles
git pull origin master
```

Unfortunately, all conflicts need to be resolved manually.

## Install All Required Tools

Install AWS CLI:

```sh
brew install awscli
```

## Install Rerquired Tools

Configure Homebrew temporarily:

```sh
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Producivity Tools

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is an interactive Unix filter for
command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes,
hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. `fzf` stands for fuzzy finder.

There are infinite ways to use it. Read
https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#examples for some insights.
The most essential use is the integration in your shell:

- Use `<CTRL-R>` to search command history.
- Use `<CTRL-T>` to find a file.
- Use `[PATTERN]**<TAB>` to run fuzzy completion.

```sh
brew install fzf
# To install useful key bindings and fuzzy completion:
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install --all
```

[zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) is a modern alternative to GNU `screen` and `tmux`:

```sh
brew install zellij
```

### iTerm2

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is the best terminal emulator available for MacOS
for now.

```sh
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Configure iTerm2:
1. Copy profiles JSON to *Downloads* folder
   ```sh
   cp ~/.korya.d/iTerm2-Profiles.json ~/Downloads/
   ```
2. Import it:
   1. Open *Settings*
   2. Select *Profiles* tab
   3. Click *Other Actions...* dropdown
   4. Then *Import JSON Profiles*
   5. Select the file from *Downloads* folder
   6. Set the imported Default profile as default
   7. Delete the old default profile

### Docker

Docker Desktop
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the easiest and the most reliable way to ship reproducible software:

```sh
brew install --cask  docker
brew install docker docker-credential-helper
```

### VSCode

[MS VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used by a lot of people and has a
lot of plugins. This is the mainstream IDE today.

```sh
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Here is a list of great extensions I use (excluding language specific ones):
- [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
   is a vim emulator
- [Error lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
   highlights errors in the code. I am not really sure why this is not part of
   the core VSCode.
- [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
   allows to develop on a remote server via SSH.
- [Modelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrislajoie.vscode-modelines)
   allows to configure VSCode via modelines in the files.
- [Github Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) is
   a great tool for generating code. It is not perfect but it is a great help.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
   is a nice tool for previewing changes inside VSCode. It is also great for
   making basic commits. Unfortunately, I was not able to use it for more
   advanced scenarios requiring rebasing.
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
   is a great tool for working with Jupyter notebooks.

### Bitwarden

I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) as my password manager. Migrated to it
recently from LastPass and it is great!

```sh
brew install --cask bitwarden
```

## Install Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is one of the best software I've discovered
in the recent years. I've been using it for a very long time. I think that I've
discovered it in some newsletter early on after they made their product
available. I gave it a try and it just worked, and it just made my life so much
easier. I recommend everyone to try it out. It is an amazing product that just
works!

Configuration:
1. Grant all required permissions:
   1. Unblock the app in *System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General*
   2. Grant Sharing permissions in *System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy*
2. Login to Tailscale
3. Enable run on start up
4. Configure password-less SSH; e.g.
   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh '<YOUR IP>' tee ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```


## Other Configurations

### Git

Recommended default settings for Git:

- `credential.helper=osxkeychain` uses the MacOS KeyChain for storing Git
   credentials.
- `pull.rebase=true` uses git rebase instead of the default git merge when
   pulling from a remote.
- `fetch.prune=true` runs git remote prune on every fetch and will automatically
   delete inaccessible Git objects in your local repository that arenâ€™t on
   remote. In short, all branches and their commits that are merged into master
   on Github gets deleted automatically in your local repo.
- `diff.colorMoved=zebra` uses a different color in git diff for code that just
   moved within a file. This makes it easier to distinguish moved code from
   other changes.

```sh
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global fetch.prune true
git config --global diff.colorMoved zebra
```

### Vim

```sh
vim +PlugInstall +PlugUpgrade +PlugUpdate
```

### SSH Key for Github

Generate SSH key for the machine:

```sh
   ssh-keygen -o -a 256 -t ed25519 -C "${USER}@$(hostname -s)-$(date +'%d-%m-%Y')"
```

Then upload it to Github:
1. Open * Settings / SSH and GPG keys* in Github: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Create a new SSH key:
   1. Click *New SSH key*
   2. Enter a title for the new key:
      ```
      awk '{ print "Developer key for " $3 }' ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
      ```
   2. Paste the public key from `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`:
      ```sh
      pbcopy <~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
      ```
   3. Click *Add SSH key*


## Last Words

That is it. This environment should be good enough to start.

Something I need to look into in the future:
- Try using `zsh`. I had a couple of failed attempts in the past.
   Maybe, it is worth giving it another try.
- Try using `neovim` instead of `macvim`. I really like its performance but the
   lack of time required to configure it blcoks me every time when I want to
   switch to it compltely. There is just always some minor feature I've got used
   to that is missing.
