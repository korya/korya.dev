I had to reset my old mac from scratch today. Here I am going to document the steps to reproduce my environment.

The main plan is as follows:
1. Configure MacOs to my preferred defaults
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)
4. Install my dotfiles from https://github.com/korya/dotfiles
5. Install all required tools


## Configure MacOS

The only changes I make to the default settings are:

- Trackpad:
   * Enable `Tap to click`. I just cannot work with a trackpad when this option is
      disabled. Pressing the trackpad make me feel weird.

- Dock:
  * Move the dock to the left. The real estate at the center of the screen is very
     precious and hence, I try to free it up for the content that requires my
     attention at this current moment. Dock is very useful and should be available
     fast when needed. But not that important to be at the bottom of the screen.

   * Turn on magnification effect on the Docker and set it to the mid level.

   * Auto-hide the dock. I don't need to see it all the time.

   * Clean it up. Remove all these stock apps from the dock. Keep Finder,
      Launchpad, Safari (later will be replaced with Chrome) and Notes.

In the past (over 5 years ago), I had some magic CLI commands for doing these
changes. But it used to break with almost every major OS ugprade.

It would be great to get these magic CLI commands for the latest MacOS. Need to check whether ChatGPT can help with that.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is my default package manager in MacOS.

Follow the instructions at https://brew.sh/. At this moment, they are:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is one of the best software I've discovered in the recent years. I've been using it for a very long time. I think that I've discovered it in some newsletter early on after they made their product available. I gave it a try and it just worked, and it just made my life so much easier. I recommend everyone to try it out. It is an amazing product that just works!
